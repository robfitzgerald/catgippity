# catgippity
A meow-riffic service for advice

## background

I was listening to a podcast and they were discussing the question of whether or not LLMs are on a meteoric rise or if we are seeing a plateau of their capabilities. They talked about image classification as an example of a problem where it may be easy to say something is of some general class (i.e., "truck"), but, much harder to identify a sub-class (i.e., "2020 Toyota Ranger"). And, they mentioned that this is mostly the case with data on the internet. Except, it turns out, for _cats_.

I found that to be such a hilarious metaphor for what is going on in the commercialization space for LLMs, and the question of AGIs. Those arguments sure make AGIs seem improbable! But what if we just needed LLMs to give us light-hearted advice from a cat? Is that something the internet is a great training corpus for? Maybe this will be peak-LLM, the Cat Gippity experience; the greatest LLM service that could ever exist. At least I can try!

## Version 0.1

I used this silly idea as an opportunity to learn Go and to familiarize myself with a LLM API while on parental leave in early summer 2024. This version is designed to run on GCP using the Gemini 1.5 Flash model.
